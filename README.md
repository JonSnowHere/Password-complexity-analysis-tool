# Password-complexity-analysis-tool
A password complexity analysis tool, also known as a password strength checker, evaluates a password's resilience against common attacks. These tools work by analyzing a password's characteristics, like length and the variety of characters used, and then calculating a score or an estimated time it would take to crack the password.
